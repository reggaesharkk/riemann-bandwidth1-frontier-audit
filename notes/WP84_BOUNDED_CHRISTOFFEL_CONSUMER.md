# WP84 — bounded rationalized Christoffel consumer

Date: 2026-10-05

Status: **NEW SUPPORT-FREE BOUNDED >79 CONSUMER; SIX SIMPLE NONREAL POLES; NO RADAU SURROGATE**

The exact degree-6 polynomial certificate is powerful but unbounded.  The
fixed-pole beta consumers are bounded but their strongest displayed values
were surrogate-law evaluations rather than moment-forced bounds.

There is a direct interpolation between the two.

## 1. Start from the exact Christoffel square

Let

    P(x)
      = 1
        - (43428/13891)x
        + (37704/13891)x^2
        - (9660/13891)x^3,

and put

    g(x)=P(x)^2.

For every positive Borel probability measure with the pinned moments through
degree six,

    integral g dnu = w0
                   = 1415/13891.

The coefficient-sign certificate gives

    g(x)>=1 for x<=0.

## 2. Rationalize without losing the half-line majorant

For any fixed delta>0 define

    F_delta(x)
      = (1+delta) g(x)/(g(x)+delta).

Then exactly

    F_delta(x)-1
      = delta (g(x)-1)/(g(x)+delta).

Since g+delta>0 on R,

    boxed:
    F_delta(x)>=1 for every x<=0.

Also

    0 <= F_delta(x)
      <= ((1+delta)/delta) g(x),

because g+delta>=delta.

Therefore every measure with the pinned moments satisfies

    nu((-infinity,0])
      <= integral F_delta dnu
      <= (1+1/delta) * 1415/13891.

This is a **moment-forced bound**, not an evaluation on one extremal
quadrature.

## 3. Choose delta=61

At delta=61,

    F_61(x)=62 g(x)/(g(x)+61).

The universal negative-mass cap is

    62/61 * 1415/13891
      = 87730/847351
      = 0.1035344267....

Hence

    positive-index mass
      >= 759621/847351
      = 0.8964655733....

and the exact zero-side ledger gives

    boxed:
    simple-zero coefficient
      >= 671891/847351
      = 0.7929311466... > 0.79.

So F_61 gives a **bounded, support-free, moment-certified >79 consumer**.

It deliberately sacrifices part of the 79.627% polynomial optimum in exchange
for bounded functional calculus.

## 4. Resolvent representation

The denominator

    g(z)+61 = P(z)^2+61

has degree six and no real zeros, because g(x)>=0 on R.

Its roots are six simple nonreal algebraic poles.  Numerically the smallest
absolute imaginary part is about

    1.0760.

Thus every consumed resolvent is safely separated from the real axis.

Writing the poles as z_j,

    F_61(x)
      = 62 + sum_{j=1}^6 c_j/(x-z_j),

with

    c_j
      = -61*62 / (2 P(z_j) P'(z_j)).

Therefore

    tau(F_61(H))
      = 62 + sum_j c_j m_H(z_j).

The theorem no longer needs:

- a high-order pole at i;
- a Cauchy circle;
- resolvent derivatives;
- a surrogate target law.

It needs only six simple fixed nonreal resolvent values.

## 5. Rank robustness

Because the consumer is a fixed bounded rational function and all six poles
stay a fixed distance from R, an o(d)-rank perturbation changes the statistic
by o(1).  This follows directly from the rank-Stieltjes bound applied to the
six partial fractions.

Thus the deep-zero deletion architecture remains intact.

## 6. Moving positive threshold

The zero-side count uses theta_T->0 rather than the strict half-line.

Since F_61 is continuous and F_61(0)=1, define

    q(theta)
      = inf_{x<=theta} F_61(x).

For sufficiently small positive theta, q(theta)>0 and q(theta)->1.

Then

    1_{x<=theta}
      <= F_61(x)/q(theta),

so the same asymptotic cap holds with a factor 1+o(1).

## 7. Quantitative diagnostic

The six residues have

    sum_j |c_j| ~= 138.885.

The certified simple-zero margin above 79% is

    0.0029311466....

Under the crude assumption that all six normalized resolvents are controlled
with the same absolute error epsilon, it is sufficient that

    epsilon
      < margin / (2 sum |c_j|)
      ~= 1.06e-5.

This number is only a diagnostic error allocation.  The asymptotic theorem
needs o(1) at the fixed poles.

## 8. Why this changes the kill gate

The previous shortest route aimed to identify an entire limiting spectral law
and then recover its moments.

For a >79 theorem that is stronger than necessary.

A sufficient bounded theorem is now:

    boxed:
    limsup_T tau(F_61(H_T))
      <= 87730/847351.

After the vanishing-threshold correction and o(d)-rank deletion, this alone
yields the 79.2931% simple-zero coefficient above.

Because F_61 is a six-pole resolvent combination, the theorem-side problem
reduces to one scalar linear combination of six fixed resolvent laws.

## 9. New active target

Attack directly

    L_61(T)
      := 62 + sum_j c_j m_{H_T}(z_j)

through the exact permutation-Lindeberg first/second-order expansion.

The required asymptotic inequality is

    limsup L_61(T)
      <= 87730/847351.

This is strictly narrower than identifying the full spectral law and avoids
finite-T raw higher moments by construction.

No unconditional >79% theorem is claimed until this six-pole inequality is
proved.
